### Impact of Relaxing Diversity Constraints
In this experiment, we adjusted the Diversity Constraint to observe its impact on optimized menus. Surprisingly, even with a significantly looser constraint, the results remained similar to more constrained settings. This suggests that menu diversity was inherently limited, aligning with the unique dietary needs of each group while optimizing cost efficiency.

### Price Sensitivity Analysis
This analysis examines the impact of item price variations on menu composition, essential for business profitability and consumer satisfaction. To maintain profitability and customer appeal, businesses like McDonaldâ€™s must understand how price adjustments affect menu choices. Similarly, consumers' purchasing decisions are influenced by price changes, emphasizing affordability and value. We conduct two experiments from these dual perspectives: one focused on inflation-based scenarios, and the other on market disruptions affecting item prices.
